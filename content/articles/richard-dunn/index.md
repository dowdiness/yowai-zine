I chose these two photos of kids for this zine because although kids can be seen as weak, they are able to accept situations as they are and enjoy themselves with an open mind and willingness to adapt.

In the great scheme of things every human being is incredibly fragile, not much stronger than a little kid.
Since last year when these photos were taken, Covid-19 has even further exposed the weakness of human beings.

“Don’t kill. Protect your weakness.”
I interpreted this to mean: if we can comprehend and accept our own weakness, we can empathise with and look after each other more.
If we are willing to approach this new situation with the open mindedness and adaptability of a kid, I think it will be easy to achieve the goal of this slogan.
